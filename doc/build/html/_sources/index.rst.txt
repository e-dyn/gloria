Gloria documentation
====================

**Version**: |version|

Gloria is a timeseries forecasting tool inspired by `Prophet <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>`_. It extends Prophet's use of generalized linear models (GLMs) to handle a wide variety of data types and constraints in a statistically coherent way through appropriate distributions such as binomial, Poisson, beta, and others.
