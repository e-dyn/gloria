Gloria documentation
====================

**Version**: |version|

**Gloria** is a flexible time series forecasting tool inspired by `Prophet <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>`_.  
It enhances Prophet‚Äôs GLM-based structure with advanced probabilistic modeling using tailored distributions  
(e.g., binomial, Poisson, beta) ‚Äì ideal for real-world forecasting under uncertainty.

   .. card:: Distributional Flexibility
      :text-align: center

      Go beyond the normal distribution and model count data (Poisson, 
      Binomial, Negative Binomial, Beta-Binomial), bounded rates (Beta), or 
      non-negative floats (Gamma) natively

   .. card:: Any Time Grid
      :text-align: center

      Gloria handles arbitrary sampling intervals (not just daily)

   .. card:: Rich Event Modeling
      :text-align: center

      Parametric and extensible event library to handle holidays, campaigns, or
      maintenance windows - any event, any shape, for realistic impacts and 
      reduced overfitting.

   .. card:: Fully Explainable
      :text-align: center

      Gloria's models are explicit, fully documented, and always inspectable.
      
   .. card:: Modern Python Stack
      :text-align: center

      Type hints, pydantic for validation, and a clean API design reminiscent 
      of `Prophet <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>`_. but with a much more
      maintainable and extensible codebase.
