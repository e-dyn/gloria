Saturation
==========

Most distribution models offered by Gloria enforce lower or upper bounds on the response variable. While the lower bound is often simply zero, the upper bound - also known as capacity - can have arbitrary values that may even change over time. In this section, we explore how Gloria handles saturation, that is, a situation in which a time-series is close to its capacity and thus becomes highly non-linear.

Data Set
--------

We use a semi-real seat-occupancy data set available `here <https://github.com/benkambs/gloria-betatest/blob/main/scripts/data/real/seat_occupancy.csv>`_. The columns ``date`` and ``count`` stem from the `Automatic Hourly Pedestrian Count <https://data.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/datasets/cityofsydney::automatic-hourly-pedestrian-count/about>`_ data set, offered by the city of Sydney [#f1]_. Additionally, there are two more simulated columns:

1. ``seats`` is the total number of seats available for pedestrians.
2. ``occupied`` records how many of those seats are taken.

Our goal is to model the number of occupied seats. It scales with the number of pedestrians - the more crowded it is, the more people tend to sit. However, the number of seats is limited. In other words, ``seats`` is the capacity of our system.

Constant Capacity
-----------------

We first restrict the data set to the initial nine days. In this range, the total number of seats is fixed at 60. As we are handling count data with an upper bound, we use the ``binomial`` model.

.. code-block:: python
   :emphasize-lines: 31

   import pandas as pd
   from gloria import Gloria, cast_series_to_kind

   # Load the data
   url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-dyn/gloria/main/scripts/data/real/seat_occupancy.csv"
   data = pd.read_csv(url).head(220)

   # Save the column names for later usage
   timestamp_name = "date"
   metric_name = "occupied"

   # Convert to datetime
   data[timestamp_name] = pd.to_datetime(data[timestamp_name])

   # Convert data type to unsigned int
   data[metric_name] = cast_series_to_kind(data[metric_name], "u")

   # Set up the Gloria model
   m = Gloria(
       model="binomial",
       metric_name=metric_name,
       timestamp_name=timestamp_name,
       sampling_period="1 h",
       n_changepoints = 5
   )

   # Add observed seasonalities
   m.add_seasonality("daily", "1d", 5)

   # Fit the model to the data
   m.fit(data, capacity=60)

   # Predict
   data_predict = data.loc[:,[timestamp_name]]
   prediction = m.predict(data_predict)

   # Plot
   m.plot(prediction, include_legend=True, show_capacity=True)

Both ``binomial`` and ``beta-binomial`` models require the capacity as user input. Accordingly, we pass the known value by ``capacity=60`` into the highlighted fit step.

.. note::
    The :meth:`~Gloria.fit` API additionally allows to pass constant capacities using ``capacity_mode`` / ``capacity_value`` pairs. For instance, ``capacity_mode="constant"`` and ``capacity_value=60`` is equivalent to ``capacity=60``, but the modes ``"factor"`` and ``"scale"`` are available as well. These are useful when the capacity is not exactly known [#f2]_.

The result of the binomial fit can be seen below. During pedestrian rush hours, virtually all seats are taken, meaning the data reach their capacity, which is shown as a dashed gray line in the plot. The fitted model saturates in this range, as can be seen by the oscillations being capped at 60. Note that not even the confidence interval violates the limit set by capacity.

Varying Capacity
----------------

Sydney surely cares for its residents and makes an effort to provide more space for sitting. Accordingly, after the initial nine days, the number of seats significantly increases. The ``binomial`` model using a *vectorized* capacity is the perfect fit for this situation. While we previously had to specify a *constant* capacity, the capacity can now vary with each data point in the time series. Accordingly, the input data must contain a capacity column. When setting up the model, we specify this column using the parameter ``capacity_name``. Note that both data frames passed to :meth:`~Gloria.fit` *and* :meth:`~Gloria.predict` must include this column. Also note that the capacity is not anymore passed as argument to :meth:`~Gloria.fit`, as it is now fully specified by the input data:

.. code-block:: python
    :emphasize-lines: 11, 18, 25, 34
    
    import pandas as pd
    from gloria import Gloria, cast_series_to_kind

    # Load the data
    url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e-dyn/gloria/main/scripts/data/real/seat_occupancy.csv"
    data = pd.read_csv(url)

    # Save the column names for later usage
    timestamp_name = "date"
    metric_name = "occupied"
    capacity_name = "seats"

    # Convert to datetime
    data[timestamp_name] = pd.to_datetime(data[timestamp_name])

    # Convert data type to unsigned int
    data[metric_name] = cast_series_to_kind(data[metric_name], "u")
    data[capacity_name] = cast_series_to_kind(data[capacity_name], "u")

    # Set up the Gloria model
    m = Gloria(
        model="binomial",
        metric_name=metric_name,
        timestamp_name=timestamp_name,
        capacity_name=capacity_name,
        sampling_period="1 h",
        n_changepoints = 5
    )

    # Add observed seasonalities
    m.add_seasonality("daily", "1d", 5)

    # Fit the model to the data
    m.fit(data)

    # Predict
    data_predict = data.loc[:,[timestamp_name, capacity_name]]
    prediction = m.predict(data_predict)

    # Plot
    m.plot(prediction, show_capacity=True, include_legend=True)
    
The grey dashed line in the plot shows that the number of seats increased from 60 to 160 within just a few days. At around 100 seats, saturation occurs less frequently and above 150 seats, the number of seated people remains well below capacity. The fitted model successfully captures both the dampened oscillations in the saturated regime and the unrestrained fluctuations when capacity is not reached.

Summary
-------

In this tutorial, we saw how Gloriaâ€™s bounded-count models behave when a time series approaches its capacity. In such cases, the models automatically dampen further growth: seasonal components are clipped to the ceiling, trend changepoints flatten, and predictive intervals are truncated so they never exceed the specified upper limit. Whether the capacity is fixed  or time-varying, Gloria incorporates the bound directly into the likelihood, allowing it to represent the transition from linear growth to a plateau without manual tuning. As a result, forecasts remain realistic even in heavily saturated regimes, while still tracking ordinary fluctuations when the system operates below capacity.

.. [#f1] More precisely, ``count`` was summed over the hourly measurements of four separate sensors distributed across the city.

.. [#f2] Available ``capacity_mode`` and ``capacity_value`` parameter pairs are listed in the following table:

   * - mode
     - description
     - value-range
   * - ``"constant"``
     - The provided ``value`` equals the capacity
     - ``value`` must be an integer :math:`\ge` the maximum of the response variable
   * - ``"factor"``
     - The capacity is the maximum of the response variable times ``value``
     - ``value`` must be :math:`\ge` 1
   * - ``"scale"``
     - The capacity is optimized such that the response variable is distributed around the expectation value :math:`N \times p` with :math:`N=` capacity and :math:`p=` ``value``. This mode is the default using ``value=0.5``
     - ``value`` must be in :math:`[0,1]`
