Gloria documentation
====================

**Version**: |version|

**Gloria** is a flexible time series forecasting tool inspired by `Prophet <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>`_.  
It enhances Prophet‚Äôs GLM-based structure with advanced probabilistic modeling using tailored distributions  
(e.g., binomial, Poisson, beta) ‚Äì ideal for real-world forecasting under uncertainty.

   .. grid-item-card:: Distributional Flexibility
      :text-align: center
      :columns: 4

      Go beyond the normal distribution and model count data (Poisson, 
      Binomial, Negative Binomial, Beta-Binomial), bounded rates (Beta), or 
      non-negative floats (Gamma) natively

   .. grid-item-card:: Any Time Grid
      :text-align: center
      :columns: 4

      Gloria handles arbitrary sampling intervals (not just daily)

   .. grid-item-card:: Rich Event Modeling
      :text-align: center
      :columns: 4

      Parametric and extensible event library to handle holidays, campaigns, or
      maintenance windows - any event, any shape, for realistic impacts and 
      reduced overfitting.

   .. grid-item-card:: Fully Explainable
      :text-align: center
      :columns: 4

      Gloria's models are explicit, fully documented, and always inspectable.
      
   .. grid-item-card:: Composable Pipelines
      :text-align: center
      :columns: 4

      Gloria'S modular design lets you build custom forecasting workflows by 
      combining and extending components like events, distributions, and 
      regressors.
      
   .. grid-item-card:: Modern Python Stack
      :text-align: center
      :columns: 4

      Type hints, pydantic for validation, and a clean API design reminiscent 
      of `Prophet <https://facebook.github.io/prophet/>`_. but with a much more
      maintainable and extensible codebase.
