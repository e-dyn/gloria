        Name       Period   Default Order

        daily      1d             4


        Whether and how the seasonalities are added depends on the mode

            - integer >= 1: the seasonality will be added with the integer used
              as maximum order

        In 'auto' mode the logic is as follows
            2. Each seasonality is only added, if the data span at least two
               full cycles of the fundamental period.
            3. The maximum order is determined by the default maximum order or
               the highest order that satisfies the Nyquist sampling theorem,
               whichever is smaller.

        Note on quarterly seasonality:
        Quarterly is a full subset of yearly. Therefore it will only be added
        if yearly won't be added to the model. This rule is independent of the
        mode in which quarterly is added.
